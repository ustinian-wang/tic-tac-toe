# tic-tac-toe

## Requirement

This is the case from <https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe>. But I implement it without guide from the tutorial.

## Analyzing procedure

It's a good way to analyze the procedure of implementation. Just use the mind map to explore uncertain. It will helps you to reduce bug rates. I shared the whole procedure with photo.

## Implementation

I uploaded the code to GitHub. See it at <https://github.com/ustinian-wang/tic-tac-toe>
The implementation seems not perfect. I see. I have the plan to optimize code in the next. Just give the time, please.

## Preview
